Bouncing Balls Documentation

This game was programmed in the Processing computer language
It uses physics-based math to calculate how the balls move

Main File:
This file controls how the game runs
In normal operation, it does 2 things: setup and draw
   - The code in setup runs once when the program starts up
   - The code in draw repeats every frame. This is where most things happen.
Before anything else, the program initializes all ball objects and global variables
   - If it initializes things in setup, they can't be accessed in draw. Variables like this are called local variables.

Setup:
In setup, the game
   - sets the screen size to fullscreen
   - sets the balls' types (standard to start for the launchable ball)
   - assigns the menu balls' postitions
The last 2 can be done in the global environment, but I happened to do it in setup


Menu:
The menu is a grey rectangle drawn with the dimensions [screen width/3] and [screen height/6]
The balls in the menu are identical to the launchable ball, but they just never move
The balls' positions are fractioned based off the screens' dimensions
   - I split the rectangle into 4 pieces and used fractional math to place the balls on the split lines
The text uses very basic Processing functions and reference their corresponding ball's position when being displayed

Balls:
The balls are made using a class
   - Each ball has properties: x-position, y-position, diameter, mass, x-acceleration, and y-acceleration, and colour
The launchable ball is referenced as b1 in the code while the menu balls are ex1, ex2, and ex3 from left to right

Gravity:
9.8m/s = 0.1633p/f
9.8m/s 60f/s 1p/m
